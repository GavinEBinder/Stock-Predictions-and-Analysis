# Stock-Predictions-and-Analysis
The goal of this project is to create a full data pipeline using the yfinance API.
First, an Airflow DAG to pull stock data every 24 hours.
Then in SQL that data would be transformed.
After this, the data would be sent to PowerBI for data visualizations and a ML Algorithm to predict the stock prices for the next day.
Currently Finished Tasks:
Creating the Airflow DAG.
To Do:
SQL Transformations
PowerBI Visualizations
ML Algorithm
